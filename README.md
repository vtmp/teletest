# TeleTest

## Introduction
this is a university project for running testcases on a microcontroller. the assertions are transmitted via uart and the microcontroller just evaluates the function and send back the return value. this setup saves valuable memory and allows easy testing without unnecessary flashing.

## Setup

#### build executable
create a folder in the project folder `mkdir build` and switch to it `cd build`. run cmake `cmake ..` to check dependencies and create the Makefile. build the project with `make`.

#### how to use
TeleTest reads from stdin. therefore you can run it simply by `./teletest`, type in the assertions and execute with EOF (`Ctrl-D` on Linux and maxOS, `Ctrl-Z` on Windows). to run TeleTest in large scale you may want to read the assertions from a simple text file. in order to do that redirect stdin `./teletest < list_of_assertions.txt`

#### assertion syntax
TeleTest uses a simple syntax for testing using the keywords *RUN*, *WITH*, *EXPECT*. for example an assertion for a function `float add(float a, float b) {return a+b;}` could look like `RUN add WITH 3.5 -1.4 EXPECT 2.1`

#### configuration
TeleTest expects the configuration file `.TeleTest.conf` in your home directory. The project directory contains an example of the configuration file: `example.conf`.
